# Strings VR
(PS. if you have a better name lmk ðŸ’€)


## Vision

### Overview
StringsVR is aimed to make a wireless SteamVR-compatible setup using the Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduinos, 6dof tracking also supported via PsMoveServiceEx. 

### Streaming
The current goal is to get under 20ms of latency with 72hz and 2k resolution. We believe this will be feasible due the use [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) and [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt)

### Hardware

| Components  | Amount |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Pro Micro | 1x  |
| NRF24L01  | 1x  |
| ICM20948  | 1x  |
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. | 1x. |
| LS055R1SX04  | 1x  |
| Customized PCB  | 1x  |
| HadesVR Or Flo3VR Controller | 2x  | 

(Around Same Hardware As Hades except with MPU change and diffrent PCB

## Progress
**65%** Visual Streaming has been optimized to the maximum (4k@60hz). What's left is forking and stripping down PiOS and sending and receiving packets
