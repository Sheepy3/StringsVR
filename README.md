## Vision

### Overview
StringsVR is aimed to make a wireless SteamVR-compatible setup using the Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduinos, 6dof tracking also supported via PsMoveServiceEx. 

### Streaming
StringsVR is currently capable of streaming 2k@72hz over a strong wifi connection with 13ms of latency.
**(This will highly depend on your Wi-Fi it is recommended to have your PC connected to ethernet)**
